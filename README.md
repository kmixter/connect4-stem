* You will need a 3D printer and filament. We used ABS, though presumably PLA also works.
* You will also want wood screws of various sizes and metal bolt/nut combos, mostly of 3mm size.
* For nicer connections, you'll also want to consider soldering iron/solder, heat shrink, and a Dupont connector kit
